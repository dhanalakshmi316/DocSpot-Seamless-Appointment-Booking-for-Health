## 📸 Screenshots & Demo

Make sure you have an `assets` folder at the project root containing the referenced images and demo video.

Images:
- Landing Page: `assets/landing_page.png`
- Login Page: `assets/login_page.png`
- Register Page: `assets/register_page.png`
- User Dashboard: `assets/user_dashboard.png`
- Book Appointment: `assets/book_doctor.png`
- Doctor Dashboard: `assets/doctor_dashboard.png`
- Admin Dashboard: `assets/admin_dashboard.png`

Demo Video:
- Recommended filename (no spaces): `assets/lopala_demo.mp4`
  - If you already have a file with spaces, keep it but note that web URLs may need encoding (e.g., `lopala%20demo.mp4`).

Embed (works on GitHub README via HTML):
```html
<video controls width="720" src="assets/lopala%20demo.mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag. Download the demo:
  <a href="assets/lopala%20demo.mp4">Download demo video</a>
</video>
```

Fallback link:
- Demo video file: [lopala_demo.mp4](assets/lopala_demo.mp4)

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm (or yarn)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

---

## 📥 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayyappavenkatasurya/DocSpot-Seamless-Appointment-Booking-for-Health.git
cd DocSpot-Seamless-Appointment-Booking-for-Health
```

2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with these variables (example):
```env
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@docspot.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm start
# or, if you prefer nodemon for development
npm run dev
```
By default the server runs on port 8080 (unless you changed PORT in `.env`).

3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Vite's dev server usually runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

Running frontend and backend concurrently
- Option A: Open two terminals and run backend and frontend separately.
- Option B: Use a tool like `concurrently` and add a script in root package.json to run both.

Notes:
- Place the demo video file at `assets/lopala_demo.mp4` (or keep your existing filename and update the README accordingly).
- Ensure `backend/uploads/` is included in `.gitignore` to avoid committing user documents.
